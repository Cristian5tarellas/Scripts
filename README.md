This repository contains various scripts I have created during my learning journey in the field of cybersecurity. 🛡️

## Main Programming Languages 🖥️

### **Bash** 🐧
The Bash scripts included here are primarily related to [Wargames](https://github.com/Cristian5tarellas/Wargames) challenges. Most of them automate access to specific levels of OverTheWire Wargames.

### **Python** 🐍
The Python scripts focus on **enumeration techniques** and **attack simulations**, such as Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
